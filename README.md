# Surfs_up Analysis with SQLite

# Overview of the statistical analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to understand the temperature trends in Hawaii before opening a new surf shop. By checking the temperatures specifically for Summer and Winter months to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

# Results of Analysis
Key differences in weather between June and December are as follows:
- The temperatures are higher in June than in December and the temperatures are lower in December than in June
- The average temperatures are almost the same during the two months, with the average temperature in June being almost 3 degrees higher
- The temperatures flucate more during December than June based on the stdev measure
- The maximum temperatures are also only different by 2 degrees, however there is a greater difference between the minimum temperatures for each month. December's lowest temperature is 6 degrees lower than June's lowest temperature
- These findings help us predict how the shop will perform through Summer and Winters and if it would be sustainable all year-round
